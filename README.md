# Object Detection using SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the **SSD MobileNet V3** model trained on the **COCO dataset**. The code detects multiple objects in an image and draws bounding boxes around them with class labels and confidence scores.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
